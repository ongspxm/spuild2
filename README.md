# Spuild: Web build tool in python

This build tool automates the web development build process. Well, there is gulp and there is grunt, which are much more feature-packed. But in a limited development environment where there is little permission, **spuild** is the tool for you.

Currently, these are plugins that are ready for use:

- Generating HTML from JADE templates
- Generating CSS form SCSS templates

## to use
`npm install spuild`
